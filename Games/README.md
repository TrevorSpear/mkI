###<i> Wampus </i>
Climb down into a cave with a rope and you can't leave till you kill the beast inside. 
You go through each room in the cave trying to find the wumpus. 
You have 3 arrows and you can't get them back after you fire them. 
There is a chance you miss and if you enter the same room as the wumpus you will die. 
Your arrow can go through 3 rooms. There are other things in the cave like bats, sandpits, and cave ins. 
You will get a sound warning or sight based on the obstacle. Killing the wumpus doesn't just end the game right then and there. 
You have to find your way back to where you entered to climb out the same way you got in. 
Don't die.
